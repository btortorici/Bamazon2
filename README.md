# Welcome to Bamazon!

### This CLI application uses Node.js and MySQL to emulate an online shopping experience.

#### How to Install and Run the Application

1. Install the app by cloning this repo and navigating to the file in the command line.
2. Remember to `npm install` so the dependencies are loaded to your local copy of the app.
3. Create a database using MySQL called __Bamazon__.  Use the code in the `bamazonSchema.sql` file to populate your `Bamazon` database with tables and some inventory. (Use Workbench, Sequel Pro or MySQL in the command line).
3. There is one dashboard to this application - __Customer View__. Run the application by typing `node bamazonCustomer.js` in the command line. Two new dashboards are coming soon.
4. Follow the prompts to__Make Bamazon Purchases__.
